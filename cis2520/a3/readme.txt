How to run the program:
- Compile the program by typeing make in the command line
- If user wants to create and evaluate binary expression tree type ./q1 into the command line followed by an equation
		- 	user must put '\' before each bracket to avoid errors
		-	user will be prompted with 7 options;1.Display the tree, 2.print the preorder equation, 3.print the inorder equation,
			4.print the postorder, 5.Update the tree variables, 6.calculate the tree total and 7.Exit the program
		- 	user must press key of desired action before pressing enter
		-	if user chooses 5, user will be prompted for two imputs; value and variable name
		-	user must enter the value followed by a space then the variable name (ex. 1.56 x1)
- if user wants to create a heap type ./q2 into the command line

Sample Output Demonstration:

./q1 \(\(\(x1+5.12\)-\(x2âˆ’7.68\)\)/x3\)
